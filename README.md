Sina Rahimi is a Building Science researcher and educator specializing in urban microclimates, energy modeling, and building envelope performance. He is an instructor at Humber College, where he teaches courses on exterior finishes and technical research reporting, and a member of the Sustainable Urban Systems Lab at Georgia Tech.
 
His research focuses on advancing simulation-based approaches for urban heat island mitigation, decarbonization, and thermal comfort in cities. As part of the lab, he contributes to the development of Eddy3D, a microclimate modeling toolkit for Rhino & Grasshopper that integrates advanced CFD workflows through OpenFOAM. The software is now adopted by leading academic institutions and professionals in the architecture, engineering industry.
 
Sina has hands-on experience with energy simulation tools including OpenFOAM, IESVE, THERM, WUFI, and WINDOW, enabling the analysis of energy flows, moisture transport, and envelope durability—particularly in complex assemblies such as historical masonry facades. He has contributed to projects addressing HVAC optimization, forensic envelope assessments, and building performance evaluations in line with ASHRAE and LEED standards.
 
He is a PhD student in Building Science from Toronto Metropolitan University, where his work bridges computational modeling and applied research. He also holds a Master’s degree in Environmental Engineering, providing a strong interdisciplinary foundation in sustainability, fluid dynamics, and energy systems in the built environment.
